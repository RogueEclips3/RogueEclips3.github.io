# About Me
Hello there stranger! My name is Josh, and I'm a game developer / software developer hobbyist. I'm currently pursueing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I hope to get a job within the computer science field. I may post some of my personal projects onto this site (no guarantee :P), so stay tuned if you're interested.
